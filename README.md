We introduces a novel method for generating artifact-resilient phase holograms in real-time. This code implements the following:
* A model for simulating pre and post-pupil obstructions (a common source of holographic artifacts).
* A differentiable metric to quantify holographic artifact resilience.
* Training and inference of a real-time neural network to create pseudo-random phase holograms that are inherently artifact-resilient.
